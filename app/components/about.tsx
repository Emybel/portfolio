        Armed with a degree in Computer Science, my journey veered from administrative roles to embrace the realm of programming. Choosing a coding bootcamp, I immersed myself in full-stack web development, reveling in the joy of problem-solving. The thrill of problem-solving is my driving force, that 'aha ðŸ’¡' moment when the solution clicks is my ultimate satisfaction. My coding arsenal boasts React, Next.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript, accompanied by an affinity for Tailwind CSS, a touch of elegance in my projects.
